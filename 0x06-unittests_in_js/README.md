## 🧪 Description of Key Files

- **0-calcul.js & 0-calcul.test.js:**  
  Basic arithmetic logic and corresponding unit tests to verify correctness.

- **1-calcul.js & 1-calcul.test.js:**  
  More advanced calculation logic and comprehensive test coverage.

- **2-calcul_chai.js & 2-calcul_chai.test.js:**  
  Demonstrates the use of Chai for expressive assertions in unit tests.

- **3-payment.js, 4-payment.js, 5-payment.js & their test files:**  
  Functions related to payment processing, each accompanied by thorough tests.

- **6-payment_token.js & 6-payment_token.test.js:**  
  Focus on token generation/validation logic and its testing.

- **7-skip.test.js:**  
  Example of how to skip or conditionally execute tests using Mocha.

- **utils.js:**  
  Shared utility functions leveraged by various modules.

- **8-api/, 9-api/, 10-api/:**  
  Subfolders likely dedicated to API integration and respective tests.

- **package.json:**  
  Lists project dependencies and test scripts (check here for the actual test command).
